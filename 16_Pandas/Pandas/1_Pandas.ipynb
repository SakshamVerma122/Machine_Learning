You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n\n#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n\n>  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Reading a CSV file using Pandas\n\n[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a popular Python library used for working in tabular data (similar to the data stored in a spreadsheet). Pandas provides helper functions to read data from various file formats like CSV, Excel spreadsheets, HTML tables, JSON, SQL, and more. Let's download a file `italy-covid-daywise.txt` which contains day-wise Covid-19 data for Italy in the following format:\n\n```\ndate,new_cases,new_deaths,new_tests\n2020-04-21,2256.0,454.0,28095.0\n2020-04-22,2729.0,534.0,44248.0\n2020-04-23,3370.0,437.0,37083.0\n2020-04-24,2646.0,464.0,95273.0\n2020-04-25,3021.0,420.0,38676.0\n2020-04-26,2357.0,415.0,24113.0\n2020-04-27,2324.0,260.0,26678.0\n2020-04-28,1739.0,333.0,37554.0\n...\n```\n\nThis format of storing data is known as *comma-separated values* or CSV. \n\n> **CSVs**: A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields.
